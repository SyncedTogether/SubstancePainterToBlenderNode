# SubstancePainterToBlenderNode
Script made to handle single/multiple textures exported from substance painter and auto create materials for them with linked Base_color, Metallic, Mixed_AO, Normal_OpenGL, and Roughness.

To use it, download the script, replace the file path for the file path that you exported your textures to, and run the script. The generated materials will be named by "GEN_*NameOfMaterialYouExported*".
